# cross-cloud-cdc-architecture-aws-gcp
Cloud-native near real-time CDC data platform design using AWS &amp; GCP, focusing on correctness, fault tolerance, schema evolution, and cost optimization.

## Overview
This repository contains the architecture design for a cloud-native, near real-time CDC data platform spanning AWS and GCP.

The design focuses on:
- Reliable CDC ingestion
- Cross-cloud fault tolerance
- Data correctness and reconciliation
- Cost-aware analytics on BigQuery

Refer to architecture/diagram.md for the end-to-end flow
